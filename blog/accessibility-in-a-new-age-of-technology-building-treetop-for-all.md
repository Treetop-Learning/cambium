*A free, all-in-one MLA formatter for your next paper.* Maribel is a website I built for my mother, to help ease her pains of writing in MLA format, as she studies to acquire her Master's degree. Thank you Mom for continuously cheering on my learning. You are my biggest fan, and I love you very much. This website can be reached at [maribel.io](https://maribel.io).
